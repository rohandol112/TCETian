## 🎯 Features Implemented

### 1. Event Sharing System

#### What It Does
- Users can share events via a unique URL
- Share count tracked and displayed in real-time
- One-click copy to clipboard functionality
- Real-time updates for all users when events are shared

#### Technical Implementation
**Backend:**
- Added `shareCount` field to Event model
- Created `shareEvent()` controller endpoint
- Created `getEventShareInfo()` controller for metadata
- Routes: `POST /api/events/:id/share` and `GET /api/events/:id/share-info`

**Frontend:**
- Share button in EventDetailsModal
- Clipboard API integration
- Real-time Socket.io listeners for share count updates
- Toast notifications for user feedback

#### User Experience
1. User opens event details
2. Clicks "Share Event" button (🔗 icon)
3. Event URL automatically copied to clipboard
4. Success toast notification appears
5. Share count updates in real-time for all viewers

---

### 2. Instagram-Style Image Upload

#### What It Does
- Event posters displayed in perfect 1:1 square format
- Live preview with gradient overlay
- Recommended size: 1080x1080px
- Supports both file upload and URL input

#### Technical Implementation
**Frontend:**
- `aspect-square` Tailwind class for 1:1 ratio
- Real-time preview generation
- Gradient overlay showing title and category
- File input with size/format validation

**Backend:**
- Multer middleware for file uploads

2. Chooses/pastes image
3. Live preview appears in perfect square
4. Gradient overlay shows event title and category
5. Submit creates event with optimized poster

---

### 3. Edit Event Feature

#### What It Does
- Club organizers can edit their events
- All event details can be modified
- Image can be changed or kept the same
- Real-time broadcast of updates to all viewers

#### Technical Implementation
**Backend:**
- Existing `updateEvent()` API utilized
- Socket.io events for broadcasting changes

**Frontend:**
- `useEventCreation` hook enhanced to accept `initialEvent`
- CreateEventModal supports both create and edit modes
- Form pre-population with existing event data
- Edit button in EventDetailsModal (organizer only)
- Nested modal architecture

#### User Experience
1. Organizer opens event details
2. Clicks "Edit Event" button
3. Form pre-populated with current data
4. Makes changes to any field
5. Clicks "Update Event"
6. Changes broadcast in real-time to all viewers

---

### 4. Real-Time Socket.io Integration

#### What It Does
- Live updates without page refresh
- Share counts update automatically
- Event modifications appear instantly
- New events appear in feed immediately

#### Technical Implementation
**Backend (socketService.js):**
```javascript
// Event sharing handler
socket.on('event_shared', ({ eventId, shareCount }) => {
  socket.to(`event_${eventId}`).emit('event_share_update', {
    eventId, shareCount, sharedBy: socket.userId, timestamp
  })
  socket.broadcast.to('events_feed').emit('event_stats_update', {
    eventId, type: 'share', shareCount, timestamp
  })
})
```

**Frontend:**
- EventDetailsModal: Listens for `event_share_update` and `event_stats_update`
- Events.jsx: Joins `events_feed` room, updates event cards in real-time
- Proper cleanup in useEffect return functions

#### Socket Events Flow
```
Client Action → Socket Emit → Server Handler → Broadcast → Other Clients Update
```

## 🔧 Bug Fixes

### 1. CORS Configuration
**Problem:** `cache-control is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Headers`

**Solution:**
```javascript
// backend/src/app.js
allowedHeaders: [
  'Content-Type',
  'Authorization',
  'X-Requested-With',
  'Cache-Control',  // Added
  'Pragma',         // Added
  'Expires'         // Added
]
```

### 2. Environment Variables
**Problem:** API calls failing due to missing `VITE_API_URL`

**Solution:**
```env
# frontend/.env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

### 3. Code Cleanup
**Problem:** Duplicate code blocks in EventDetailsModal

**Solution:** Removed duplicate lines 180-186 in EventDetailsModal.jsx

## 🎨 Design Patterns Used

### 1. Component Composition
```
EventDetailsModal
├── CreateEventModal (nested for editing)
├── Socket listeners (useEffect)
└── Event actions (share, edit, delete, RSVP)
```

### 2. Custom Hooks
```javascript
useEventCreation(onEventCreated, initialEvent)
├── Form state management
├── Validation logic
├── Create/Update API calls
└── Socket.io broadcasting
```

### 3. Context Pattern
```
App
└── SocketProvider
    ├── AuthProvider
    └── ToastProvider
        └── Components (access socket, auth, toasts)
```

### 4. Real-Time Architecture
```
User Action → API Call → Database Update → Socket Emit → All Clients Update
```

---

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### 1. Authentication
- JWT tokens for API requests
- Socket.io authentication via token
- User role validation (club, student)

### 2. File Upload Security
- File type validation (JPG, PNG, WebP only)
- File size limit (5MB max)
- Multer middleware sanitization
- Unique filename generation

### 3. Authorization
- Edit event: Club organizer only
- Share event: Public
- RSVP: Students only
- Delete event: Organizer only

---

## 📊 Performance Optimizations

### 1. Socket.io Rooms
- Events grouped by rooms (`event_{id}`, `events_feed`)
- Targeted broadcasting instead of global
- Automatic room cleanup on disconnect

### 2. Image Handling
- File size limits prevent large uploads
- Aspect ratio enforcement reduces processing
- Preview generation client-side

### 3. State Management
- Local state updates before API calls
- Optimistic UI updates
- Socket updates for consistency

## 🐛 Known Issues

### Minor Issues
1. **Socket reconnection:** Manual refresh needed after long disconnection
   - *Fix:* Implement auto-reconnect with exponential backoff

2. **Image preview lag:** Large images take time to preview
   - *Fix:* Implement client-side image compression

3. **Share count race condition:** Simultaneous shares may cause inconsistency
   - *Fix:* Implement atomic increment in MongoDB

### Enhancement Opportunities
1. Add loading skeleton for image preview
2. Implement drag-and-drop image upload
3. Add image filters/effects
4. Support multiple images per event
5. Add event cover video support
