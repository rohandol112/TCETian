# 🔧 Event Management Edit Fix - Quick Reference

## Issue Resolved
**Problem:** Club accounts couldn't edit event details through the "Manage Event" button in Events page or the EventDashboard.

**Solution:** Added proper event editing functionality to both interfaces with direct edit modal access.

---

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. **EventDashboard.jsx** - Club Dashboard
**Changes:**
- ✅ Added `editingEvent` state to track event being edited
- ✅ Added `selectedEventId` and `showDetailsModal` for viewing events
- ✅ Added `handleEditEvent()` function to open edit modal
- ✅ Added `handleViewEvent()` function to view event details
- ✅ Added `handleEventUpdated()` to refresh after edits
- ✅ Connected Edit button onClick handler
- ✅ Connected View button onClick handler
- ✅ Imported EventDetailsModal component
- ✅ Added EventDetailsModal at bottom of component

**How It Works Now:**
```
Dashboard → Hover over event → Click Edit icon → Opens CreateEventModal in edit mode
Dashboard → Hover over event → Click Eye icon → Opens EventDetailsModal for viewing
```

### 2. **Events.jsx** - Main Events Page
**Changes:**
- ✅ Added `editingEvent` state to track event being edited
- ✅ Added `handleManageEvent(event)` function
- ✅ Updated "Manage Event" button to call `handleManageEvent` instead of `handleEventClick`
- ✅ Updated `handleEventCreated` to show correct message for edit/create
- ✅ Updated CreateEventModal to receive `event={editingEvent}` prop
- ✅ Added cleanup in modal onClose to reset `editingEvent`

**How It Works Now:**
```
Events Page → Click "Manage Event" button (club only) → Opens CreateEventModal in edit mode
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### State Management
```javascript
// Events.jsx
const [editingEvent, setEditingEvent] = useState(null)

// When Manage Event clicked
const handleManageEvent = (event) => {
  setEditingEvent(event)      // Store full event object
  setShowCreateModal(true)    // Open modal
}

// Modal receives event prop
<CreateEventModal
  event={editingEvent}        // Pre-populate form
  onEventCreated={...}
  onClose={() => {
    setShowCreateModal(false)
    setEditingEvent(null)     // Clean up
  }}
/>
```

### Pre-population Logic (useEventCreation hook)
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  if (initialEvent) {
    // Convert event data to form format
    setFormData({
      title: initialEvent.title,
      description: initialEvent.description,
      category: initialEvent.category,
      eventDate: formatDate(initialEvent.date),
      eventTime: formatTime(initialEvent.date),
      // ... all other fields
    })
  }
}, [initialEvent])
```

### API Call (Create vs Update)
```javascript
const response = initialEvent 
  ? await eventService.updateEvent(initialEvent._id, submitData)
  : await eventService.createEvent(submitData)
```
